                "Fast Pass” is a loss run waiver only for prospects / workspaces which meet all the requirements listed below.  
                A Fast Pass does not shorten the standard WC UW SLA nor does it eliminate any other requirement such as WC UW questions, 
                dec sheets/current WC pricing, SUTA documentation, etc. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If it is discovered during the underwriting process that the prospect does not meet the Fast Pass criteria below, currently valued loss runs will be required as per standard procedures.
