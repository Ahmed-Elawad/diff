    <description>Navigator OT evaluates only the FLSA&apos;s Executive, Administrative, Creative &amp; Learned Professional, Computer and Outside Sales exemptions (and state law equivalents). Profession-specific exemptions, like retail commissioned sales, agricultural, motor carrier, certain automotive dealership positions, farm worker and seasonal/recreational are not covered by the tool. In situations where the tool will not effectively analyze the position, your analysis for non-covered exemptions must be compiled manually. Consult with your coach if you are unsure whether the tool will effectively analyze the position.</description>
