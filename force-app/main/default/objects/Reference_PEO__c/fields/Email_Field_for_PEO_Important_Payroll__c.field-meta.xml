    <formula>if(ispickval(Payment_Options__c,&quot;Secure Funding Wire&quot;),&quot;We recommend that you enroll in our Online Reports service, which gives you access to your invoice as soon as it is available. This helps ensure that you wire full payments one business day prior to check date as required. A representative from our financial department will contact you with initial wiring instructions.&quot;,&quot;We will debit your bank account for the full invoice total one business day before the payroll check date. Therefore, we recommend you have the funds available in your account two business days before the check date.&quot;)</formula>
