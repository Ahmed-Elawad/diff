    <description>tells the system that this is a large bundle, and so instead of doing the typical addition of lines and calculations all in one action, it essentially splits the addition of the lines and the calculations of those lines into two separate actions, allowing for the CPU timeout limit to be reset between them, and preventing a timeout.</description>
